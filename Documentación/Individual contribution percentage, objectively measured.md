- **Individual contribution percentage, objectively measured**

We use the self-assessment method to assign scores to each task done by each team member. Also the total score of the sprint is 100%, divided in 4 members, each member must perform a total of 25% of each sprint. This score is almost equivalent to the total effort in hours for each delivery, so each task is scored according to the hours of effort as it is merely equivalent.
