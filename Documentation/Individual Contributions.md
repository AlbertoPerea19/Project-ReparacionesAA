# Individual Contributions

We evaluate each of the members based on what they have attributed to the project, this will be measured in percentages, i.e. at the time of recording a grade this is what would be equivalent to that grade. For example:
If the grade is 95, those who have 100% would have the full grade and those who do not, would have the equivalent.
