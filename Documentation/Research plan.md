Once we know about the company we need to know about the  definitions of the proyect

## What is an API?

An **API** is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another. It also contains the terms of this data exchange.

The software that needs to access information (i.e., X hotel room rates for certain dates) or functionality (i.e., a route from point A to point B on a map based on a user’s location) from another software, calls its API while specifying the requirements of how data/functionality must be provided. The other software returns data/functionality requested by the former application.

And the interface by which these two applications communicate is what the API specifies.

*Types of APIs by availability*

**Private APIs.**

**Partner APIs.**

**Public APIs.**

### APIs by use cases

Database APIs. Database APIs enable communication between an application and a database management system. Developers work with databases by writing queries to access data, change tables, etc. The Drupal 7 Database API, for example, allows users to write unified queries for different databases, both proprietary and open source (Oracle, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, CouchDB, and MSSQL).

Another example is ORDS database API, which is embedded into Oracle REST Data Services.



# What is data storage?

Data storage refers to magnetic, optical or mechanical media that records and preserves digital information for ongoing or future operations.

## Data storage defined

There are two types of digital information: input and output data. Users provide the input data. Computers provide output data. But a computer's CPU can't compute anything or produce output data without the user's input. 

Users can enter the input data directly into a computer. However, they have found early on in the computer-era that continually entering data manually is time- and energy-prohibitive. One short-term solution is computer memory, also known as random access memory (RAM). But its storage capacity and memory retention are limited. Read-only memory (ROM) is, as the name suggests, the data can only be read but not necessarily edited. They control a computer's basic functionality. 

Although advances have been made in computer memory with dynamic RAM (DRAM) and synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), they are still limited by cost, space and memory retention. When a computer powers down, so does the RAM's ability to retain data. The solution? Data storage. 

With data storage space, users can save data onto a device. And should the computer power down, the data is retained. And instead of manually entering data into a computer, users can instruct the computer to pull data from storage devices. Computers can read input data from various sources as needed, and it can then create and save the output to the same sources or other storage locations. Users can also share data storage with others. 

Today, organizations and users require data storage to meet today's high-level computational needs like big data projects, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and the internet of things (IoT). And the other side of requiring huge data storage amounts is protecting against data loss due to disaster, failure or fraud. So, to avoid data loss, organizations can also employ data storage as backup solutions. 

**How data storage works**
In simple terms, modern computers, or terminals, connect to storage devices either directly or through a network. Users instruct computers to access data from and store data to these storage devices. However, at a fundamental level, there are two foundations to data storage: the form in which data takes and the devices data is recorded and stored on.





# What Is a Database?

# Database defined

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query 

## What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?

SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control. SQL was first developed at IBM in the 1970s with Oracle as a major contributor, which led to implementation of the SQL ANSI standard, SQL has spurred many extensions from companies such as IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. Although SQL is still widely used today, new programming languages are beginning to appear.language (SQL) for writing and querying data.

##  What is database software?

Database software is used to create, edit, and maintain database files and records, enabling easier file and record creation, data entry, data editing, updating, and reporting. The software also handles data storage, backup and reporting, multi-access control, and security. Strong database security is especially important today, as data theft becomes more frequent. Database software is sometimes also referred to as a “database management system” (DBMS).

Database software makes data management simpler by enabling users to store data in a structured form and then access it. It typically has a graphical interface to help create and manage the data and, in some cases, users can construct their own databases by using database software.

## What is a database management system (DBMS)?

A database typically requires a comprehensive database software program known as a database management system (DBMS). A DBMS serves as an interface between the database and its end users or programs, allowing users to retrieve, update, and manage how the information is organized and optimized. A DBMS also facilitates oversight and control of databases, enabling a variety of administrative operations such as performance monitoring, tuning, and backup and recovery.

Some examples of popular database software or DBMSs include MySQL, Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server, FileMaker Pro, Oracle Database, and dBASE.

## What is a MySQL database?

MySQL is an open source relational database management system based on SQL. It was designed and optimized for web applications and can run on any platform. As new and different requirements emerged with the internet, MySQL became the platform of choice for web developers and web-based applications. Because it’s designed to process millions of queries and thousands of transactions, MySQL is a popular choice for ecommerce businesses that need to manage multiple money transfers. On-demand flexibility is the primary feature of MySQL.

MySQL is the DBMS behind some of the top websites and web-based applications in the world, including Airbnb, Uber, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.



## Using databases to improve business performance and decision-making

With massive data collection from the Internet of Things transforming life and industry across the globe, businesses today have access to more data than ever before. Forward-thinking organizations can now use databases to go beyond basic data storage and transactions to analyze vast quantities of data from multiple systems. Using database and other computing and business intelligence tools, organizations can now leverage the data they collect to run more efficiently, enable better decision-making, and become more agile and scalable. Optimizing access and throughput to data is critical to businesses today because there is more data volume to track. It’s critical to have a platform that can deliver the performance, scale, and agility that businesses need as they grow over time.

The self-driving database is poised to provide a significant boost to these capabilities. Because self-driving databases automate expensive, time-consuming manual processes, they free up business users to become more proactive with their data. By having direct control over the ability to create and use databases, users gain control and autonomy while still maintaining important security standards.



## What Are Push Notifications?

Push notifications are clickable pop-up messages that appear on your users’ browsers irrespective of the device they’re using or the browser they’re on. They serve as a quick communication channel enabling companies to convey messages, offers, or other information to their customers. Subscribers can be anywhere on the browser and still receive these messages as long as they’re online or have their browsers running on their devices.

### The anatomy of push notifications

Push notifications are made up of several elements. They typically consist of a title, a message, an image, and a URL. Choose an image that adds context, and emojis that communicate your message in fewer words. Below is a pictorial representation of what push notifications comprise:

![los diferentes elementos de la notificación push web](https://static.wingify.com/gcp/uploads/2019/08/Image-1.png)

### **Push notifications on wearables:**

Push notifications can now be sent on wearable devices as well. If you’ve noticed, people wearing Smart Watches are able to receive notifications on their wearables. These devices are ideally synchronized with their smartphones allowing the wearables to display notifications directly from their mobile apps. Both mobile and wearables give you the leverage to adjust notification settings. You can opt-in to receive notifications from some apps while disabling the feature for the rest.  

Since the screen size of wearables is smaller than smartphones, push notifications look quite different on the former than the latter. Notifications on wearables are shorter and more crispier than mobile notifications.





# BOT API TELEGRAM



# Bots: An introduction for developers

Bots are third-party applications that run inside Telegram. Users can interact with bots by sending them messages, commands and inline requests. You control your bots using HTTPS requests to our Bot API.

### 1. What can I do with bots?

[![A chat with a bot also showing search results from the @gif inline-bot](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140663/1/uHVzwsRJz3Y/a499733c59840694ca)](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140081/1/VldnlW70g2I/a140b0216e7d156ebc)

To name just a few things, you could use bots to:

- **Get customized notifications and news**. A bot can act as a smart newspaper, sending you relevant content as soon as it's published.
- Integrate with other services. A bot can enrich Telegram chats with content from external services.
  Gmail Bot, GIF bot, IMDB bot, Wiki bot, Music bot, Youtube bot, GitHubBot
- Accept payments from Telegram users. A bot can offer paid services or work as a virtual storefront. Read more »
  Demo Shop Bot, Demo Store
- Create custom tools. A bot may provide you with alerts, weather forecasts, translations, formatting or other services.
  Markdown bot, Sticker bot, Vote bot, Like bot
- Build single- and multiplayer games. A bot can offer rich HTML5 experiences, from simple arcades and puzzles to 3D-shooters and real-time strategy games.
  GameBot, Gamee
- **Build social services**. A bot could connect people looking for conversation partners based on common interests or proximity.
- **Do virtually anything else**. Except for dishes — bots are terrible at doing the dishes.

### 2. How do bots work?

At the core, Telegram Bots are special accounts that do not require an additional phone number to set up. Users can interact with bots in two ways:

- Send messages and commands to bots by opening a chat with them or by adding them to groups.
- Send requests directly from the input field by typing the bot's @username and a query. This allows sending content from inline bots directly into any chat, group or channel.

Messages, commands and requests sent by users are passed to the software running on your servers. Our intermediary server handles all encryption and communication with the Telegram API for you. You communicate with this server via a simple HTTPS-interface that offers a simplified version of the Telegram API. We call that interface our Bot API.

### 3. How do I create a bot?

[![The Botfather. Click for hi-res picture](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140763/1/PihKNbjT8UE/03b57814e13713da37)](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140327/1/zlN4goPTupk/9ff2f2f01c4bd1b013)

There's a… bot for that. Just talk to BotFather  and follow a few simple steps. Once you've created a bot and received your authentication token, head down to the Bot API manual to see what you can teach your bot to do.

### 4. How are bots different from humans?

- Bots have no online status and no last seen timestamps, the interface shows the label **'bot'** instead.
- Bots have limited cloud storage — older messages may be removed by the server shortly after they have been processed.
- Bots can't initiate conversations with users. A user **must** either add them to a group or send them a message first. People can use `t.me/<bot_username>` links or username search to find your bot.
- Bot usernames always end in 'bot' (e.g. @TriviaBot, @GitHub_bot).
- When added to a group, bots do not receive all messages by default (see Privacy mode).
- Bots never eat, sleep or complain (unless expressly programmed otherwise).

### 5. Bot perks

Telegram bots are unique in many ways — we offer two kinds of keyboards, additional interfaces for default commands and deep linking as well as text formatting, integrated payments and more.

#### Inline mode

Users can interact with your bot via inline queries straight from the text input field in any chat. All they need to do is start a message with your bot's username and then type a query.

Having received the query, your bot can return some results. As soon as the user taps one of them, it is sent to the user's currently opened chat. This way, people can request content from your bot in any of their chats, groups or channels.

Check out this blog to see a sample inline bot in action. You can also try the @sticker and @music bots to see for yourself.

[![New input field](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140558/1/POjp00-nHqE/50d0312845a05e6da9)](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140558/1/POjp00-nHqE/50d0312845a05e6da9)

We've also implemented an easy way for your bot to switch between inline and PM modes.



#### Keyboards

Traditional chat bots can of course be taught to understand human language. But sometimes you want some more formal input from the user — and this is where **custom keyboards** can become extremely useful.

Whenever your bot sends a message, it can pass along a special keyboard with predefined reply options . Telegram apps that receive the message will display your keyboard to the user. Tapping any of the buttons will immediately send the respective command. This way you can drastically simplify user interaction with your bot.

We currently support text and emoji for your buttons. Here are some custom keyboard examples:

[![Keyboard for a poll bot](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140184/1/5YJxx-rostA/ad3f74094485fb97bd)](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140184/1/5YJxx-rostA/ad3f74094485fb97bd)  



#### Inline keyboards and on-the-fly updating

There are times when you'd prefer to do things without sending any messages to the chat. For example, when your user is changing settings or flipping through search results. In such cases you can use Inline Keyboards that are integrated directly into the messages they belong to.

Unlike with custom reply keyboards, pressing buttons on inline keyboards doesn't result in messages sent to the chat. Instead, inline keyboards support buttons that work behind the scenes: callback buttons, URL buttons and switch to inline buttons.

[![A URL button](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140999/1/2JSoUVlWKa0/4fad2e2743dc8eda04)](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140999/1/2JSoUVlWKa0/4fad2e2743dc8eda04)

When callback buttons are used, your bot can update its existing messages (or just their keyboards) so that the chat remains tidy. Check out these sample bots to see inline keyboards in action: @music, @vote, @like.



#### Location and Number

Some bots need extra data from the user to work properly. For example, knowing the user's location helps provide more relevant geo-specific results. The user's phone number can be very useful for integrations with other services, like banks, etc.

Bots can ask a user for their **location** and **phone number** using special buttons. Note that both phone number and location request buttons will only work in private chats.

[![Phone number and location sharing buttons](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140587/2/jaowDLZg2l0/5ba3f7d7fd5c6c28dc)](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140587/2/jaowDLZg2l0/5ba3f7d7fd5c6c28dc)

When these buttons are pressed, Telegram clients will display a confirmation alert that tells the user what's about to happen.
