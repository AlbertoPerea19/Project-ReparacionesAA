# Work Process



## *<u>Methods and tools</u>*

### **Organize, control and manage tasks and work: *Planner.***

Microsoft Planner is a web tool for work management. It is an Office 365 service. This easy-to-use tool allows you to plan tasks and manage small projects without complex planning effort. With Microsoft Planner, you can efficiently allocate and organize time and tasks. You can also set deadlines, share files and, of course, team members can communicate with each other.

This is what we did in this manager:

- We assigned tasks to each team member and their due date.

- We keep track of all the tasks done and to do. With this we control what each team member is working on and their progress on their corresponding tasks.

- We attach files to the tasks, and so we work on those files within the application.

  

### Comunication: Microsoft Teams 

We use microsoft teams as a communication tool, since it offers us different functionalities such as calls, messages and activities, all of them organized. 

We use this platform in this way:

- We create a channel for our team, called "ekipo 7", where we keep order in terms of communication and project management. Here we organize routine meetings.
- We follow up on scheduled activities and mentions.
- Every week we have two meetings of which one is just the team and the second one is with the teacher (this may vary depending on the amount of tasks).

### Comunication: Whatsapp

WhatsApp Messenger, or simply WhatsApp, is an American freeware, cross-platform centralized instant messaging and voice-over-IP service owned by Facebook, Inc. It allows users to send text messages and voice messages, make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other content

In this application is where we communicate the most, here we agree if we need to schedule an additional meeting or if there should be a modification of a task or to notify if a team member had an unforeseen event, etc.

### Comunication: Telegram	

Telegram is a multi-platform messaging service founded by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov. It first rolled out on iOS and Android in late 2013, and now has an estimated 550 million monthly users. Telegramâ€™s user base tends to increase whenever a privacy scandal hits one of its larger competitors. 

What makes Telegram unique is its focus on privacy, encryption, and an open-source API. There are countless unofficial clients to go along with the official Telegram apps and web interface. It also allows multiple devices to use the same account (verified by SMS), and multiple accounts on the same device.

### **Diagrams: Lucidchart**

Lucidchart is a web-based diagramming tool that allows users to collaborate and work together in real time, creating flowcharts, website diagrams, UML designs, among many other types of diagrams. 

In this application/website we make all together in real time the different diagrams or assign the tasks that correspond to each one and so we leave to free opinion to do it at any time.



###  Version control software: Github

GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features

Here we simplify the process of working with other people, as it facilitates collaboration on the project. In Github team members can work on files and easily merge their changes with the main branch of the project.
