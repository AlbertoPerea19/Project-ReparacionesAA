We advanced on the functions of the bot, we all gathered and added the function of sending an adress and location on telegram automatically, this by sending coordinates and a google maps link.

We discussed about our cases diagram, because the original one didn't work anymore, because it was based on WhatsApp implementation, and it also was not well abstracted.
We also thought about the new classes we would need to add, because by the moment, we only had:

User

Main.
