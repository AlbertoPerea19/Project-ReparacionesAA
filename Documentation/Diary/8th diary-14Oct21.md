The routine video call was held with the senior manager, where they talked about the various things that are pending to be done:

- Start reviewing alternatives for implementation in WhatsApp and if not, in other apps.
- Take a sample of requirements to start with, and present at the next meeting the progress.
- Start implementing the code.

Also asked about the differences of this first delivery with the next one:

- The difference of the first and second deliverable, modify and add in use cases and requirements.
- The task list hardly changes, the progress does.
