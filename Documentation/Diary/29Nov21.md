November 29th:

As a team, we had a meeting to discuss about the scripts of our video and later on, at 5:00pm we had a call to record the exposure video. We took turns and recorded it on a single take, together. After we ended recording the video, we talked about some pending things relative to the 2nd delivery of the ASTRO Project.
