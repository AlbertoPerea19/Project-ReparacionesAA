We discussed some points with professor Cambranes, related to the usage of the data base:

We talked about the data the database would gather, if a administrator would be the one to check the command to check dates related to the warranty and the reparation.

Also we talked about the way we would implement the warranties, because of the way the days counted, also we talked about the function related to show the status of the reparation.

We also discussed some abstractions about the way we would implemment or not some classes on the data base.

We took and worked on the observations of making our diagrams in english.

We talked about the way the class quotation would work with the other classes, and discussed the methods and in which class these would be implemented.
