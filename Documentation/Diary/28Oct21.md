We had a reunion with professor Cambranes, we showed him our individual progress on the project.

We discussed about some elements and information about our program, specifically about the needs of the business and what the program needed or didn't need to store (data)
This data related to the user.
We exposed our implementation diagram. 

We showed our first python bot that could only say Hello World!
Later on, we discussed about the future of the project because the language was not objet oriented and this could imply difficulties.

We also spoke about some details of the bases of our data base.

After our meeting with Professor Cambranes, we assigned tasks to each member of the team.
