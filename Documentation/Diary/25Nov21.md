We showed our bot to the professor, and received feedback.
Objectively, our bot worked, but lacked of object orientation and of basic algorythm standards.
We showed primitive data base advances and a diagram of relation of the program and data base.
We discussed about changing the code to objet orient it more and to refactor it.

We also stablished our backend would be done in java language.
