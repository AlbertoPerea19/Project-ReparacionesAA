In this meeting with professor Cambranes, we talked and showed our progress by these artefacts:
Database tables.
Skeleton of the program's code.
Some blueprints of the classes NOW IMPLEMENTED on the code (not only diagram)

We established, we had pending making a table of the register of parts used on the reparation and that next meeting we would show our updated diagram.


Later, after the meeting ended we designed tasks to each team member.
