- **Monitoring**

  We work through a log of meetings in the Teams platform clarifying details in WhatsApp, where we divide the work and everyone scores their performance based on hours of work, approximately 1 hour per point. 
  As we move through the project everyone reviews everyone's information to be in agreement and make sure we are working correctly. Although we have assigned activities and roles to each member, the assigned tasks may vary because we try to have flexibility and that we all develop in all areas to have better performance.

- **Defined work process**

  We actually use agile scrum methodology

  ##### What is scrum?

  In short, scrum refers to a framework that makes for effective collaborations among teams that are working on complex products. Although it is most often used by software development teams, scrum can essentially be beneficial to any team that is working toward a common goal. In particular, scrum is a collection of meetings, roles and tools that work together to help teams to better structure and manage their workload.

  ##### Who can benefit from scrum?

  While scrum can benefit a wide variety of businesses and projects, these are the most likely beneficiaries:

  - **Complicated projects**: Scrum methodology is ideal for projects that require teams to complete a backlog.

    

  - **Companies that value results**: Scrum is also beneficial to companies that value results over the documented progress of the process.

    

  - **Companies that cater to customers**: Scrum can help companies that develop products in accordance with customer preferences and specifications.

  ##### What is agile?

  Agile is a process that allows a team to more efficiently manage a project by breaking it down into several stages, each of which allows for consistent collaboration with stakeholders to promote steady improvements at every stage.

  ##### What are the 12 principles of agile?

  Here are the 12 principles of agile:

  - Customer satisfaction
  - Early and continuous delivery
  - Embrace change
  - Frequent delivery
  - Collaboration of businesses and developers
  - Motivated individuals
  - Face-to-face conversation
  - Functional products
  - Technical excellence
  - Simplicity
  - Self-organized teams
  - Regulation, reflection and adjustment

  ##### What are the benefits of agile scrum methodology?

  Here are some of the collective benefits of agile scrum methodology:

  - Flexibility and adaptability
  - Creativity and innovation
  - Lower costs
  - Quality improvement
  - Organizational synergy
  - Employee satisfaction
  - Customer satisfaction

  The greatest benefit of agile scrum methodology is its flexibility. With the sprint-based model, the scrum team typically receives feedback from stakeholders after each sprint. If there are any problems or changes, the scrum team can easily and quickly adjust product goals during future sprints to provide more valuable iterations. This way, stakeholders are happier because they get exactly what they want after being involved every step of the way.

  Compare this with traditional project management systems, in which stakeholders do not provide frequent feedback and time is wasted making changes to the product halfway through development – or, worse, the teams need to start from scratch after the product has already been built.

  To implement agile scrum methodology, there must be either a scrum expert in the company or an outside scrum [consultant](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4610-business-consultant.html) to ensure scrum principles are being applied correctly. Agile scrum methodology involves precise execution, which could result in a disaster if not done properly.         

  ##### What are the different roles in agile scrum methodology?

  Agile scrum methodology consists of two sets of roles: core roles, known as "pigs," and ancillary roles, known as "chickens."

  There are three core roles: scrum master, product owner and scrum team. All of these people are committed to the scrum project.

  1. **Scrum master.** The scrum master is the facilitator of the scrum development process. In addition to holding daily meetings with the scrum team, the scrum master makes certain that scrum rules are being enforced and applied as intended. The scrum master's responsibilities also include coaching and motivating the team, removing impediments to sprints, and ensuring that the team has the best possible conditions to meet its goals and produce deliverable products.

     

  2. **Product owner.** The product owner represents stakeholders, which are typically customers. To ensure the scrum team is always delivering value to stakeholders and the business, the product owner determines product expectations, records changes to the product and administers a scrum backlog, a detailed and constantly updated to-do list for the scrum project. The product owner is also responsible for prioritizing goals for each sprint, based on their value to stakeholders, such that the most important and deliverable features are built in each iteration.

     

  3. **Scrum team.**The scrum team is a self-organized group of three to nine individuals who have the business, design, analytical and development skills to carry out the actual work, solve problems and produce deliverable products. Members of the scrum team self-administer tasks and are jointly responsible for meeting each sprint's goals.

  Ancillary roles, on the other hand, are other stakeholders who are involved in, but not committed to, the scrum project. Typically, ancillary roles consist of customers, management and members of the executive team who are involved for the purpose of consulting, reporting progress and gathering feedback to better work toward delivering the highest value possible.

- **Use of a teamwork process**

1. **Backlog Organization -** This event, sometimes referred to as a backlog cleanup, is the responsibility of the product owner. The main jobs of the product owner are to steer the product towards their product vision and stay on top of the market and customers. Therefore, he or she maintains this list using feedback from users and the development team to help prioritize and keep the list clean and ready to work on at any time. You can get more information on how to maintain a backlog in the most appropriate way here.

2. **Sprint planning:** In this meeting, the entire development team plans the work to be done (scope) during the current sprint. This meeting is led by the scrum expert and in it, the team decides the objective of the sprint. Later, specific user stories are added to the sprint from the product backlog. These stories are always fit for purpose and are also agreed upon by the scrum team so that it is feasible to implement them during the sprint.

   At the end of the planning meeting, each member of the scrum should be clear about what can be delivered in the sprint and how the increment can be delivered.

3. **Sprint -** A sprint is the actual period in which the scrum team works together to finalize an increment. The duration of a sprint is usually two weeks, although some teams report that it is easier for them a week to reach or a month to deliver a valuable increment. Scrum.org's Dave West cautions that the more complex the job and the more unknowns, the shorter the sprint should be. But this really depends on your equipment, and you shouldn't be afraid to change it if it doesn't work. During this period, the product owner and the development team may renegotiate the scope, if necessary. Here's the crux of the empirical nature of the scrum.

   All events (from planning to retrospective) take place during the sprint. Once a certain time interval is set for a sprint, it must remain consistent throughout the development period. This helps the team learn from past experiences and apply that knowledge to future sprints.

4. **Daily Scrum or Quick Meeting:** This is a very short daily meeting that always takes place at the same time (usually in the morning) and in the same place to make things easier. Many teams try to end the meeting in 15 minutes, but that's just a guide. This meeting is also called a "daily quick meeting" and this emphasizes that it should be fast. The goal of the daily scrum is for all team members to be on the same page, stick to the sprint goal and have a plan for the next 24 hours.

   The quick meeting is the time to voice any concerns you have with meeting the sprint goal or to report existing impediments.

   A common way to run the quick meeting is for each team member to answer three questions in the context of reaching the sprint goal:

• What I did yesterday?
• What do I have planned for today?
• Are there any obstacles?

However, we have observed that this meeting can quickly turn into a time where employees read their agendas for the day before and the day after. The theory behind the daily meeting is that distracting conversations take place in the daily meeting, so the team can focus on work for the rest of the day. So if it turns into a read aloud of the daily schedule, don't be afraid to change it up and get creative.

5. **Sprint Review:** At the end of the sprint, the team meets in an informal session to watch a demonstration or inspect the increment. The development team shows the backlog items that are now "finished" to stakeholders and teammates for feedback. The product owner can decide whether or not he launches the increment, although in most cases the increment is thrown.

This review meeting also occurs when the product owner reviews the product backlog based on the current sprint, which can be used in the next sprint planning session. For a one-month sprint, limit your sprint review to a maximum of four hours.

6. **Sprint Retrospective -** Retrospective is where the team comes together to document and analyze what has worked and what has not worked in a sprint, a project, in people or relationships, tools or even for certain protocols. The idea is to create a place where the team can focus primarily on what went well and what needs to be improved next time, and less on what went wrong.
