**Rafael**: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of 'Facultad de matemáticas', I would like to welcome you here today. For those of you who don’t know me yet, my name is 'Rafael Perea' and I’m responsible for this project. Today we are here to talk to you about "astro". "Astro" is a work plan that I personally find extremely interesting because of the great areas of opportunity and improvement that it has. With the help of "astro" we offer a greater optimization in the development of the activities of small and medium-sized companies.

**Omar**: Hello people my name is Omar and I will be talking to you about the following subjects. Who else but me could be introducing you the project’s definition and description? Nobody. Okay, let’s begin.
Our objective is to upgrade customers experience while being attended by the enterprise, the goal is to make reparaciones AA The best option in the market Our project is basically an automatic station of the existing customer service provided and a few additions such as a database that contains clients info and of the repaired devices. The originality and innovation will come from the enlisted features, such as data storage evidence of the Reparacion and tracking of the process we are aiming to become number one business in the market. That’s a big goal our team message distinct Reparacion centers more than 12 and none of them offers one percent of the things our project will give with this product. As a team we want to give a tool that turns any average service business into a top one.

**Rafael**: Now I would like to look at how we do this big project, for this we create a calendar where we have established a time for each of the activities, here we schedule dates for the progress of the project, the start and end of each sprint, meetings with senior management and many other activities. In addition to this, we created a chronogram where each of the scheduled tasks is specified. With this we expect to deliver the "Astro" project on time and in perfect conditions.

**Ruth**: On the use cases we describe provide quotation and repair report from the system and also describe for the user request for quote and select repair.
If we talk about teamwork we work through a log of meetings with scrum model using sprints and the Teams platform clarifying details in WhatsApp, where we divide the work and everyone scores their performance based on hours of work, approximately 1 hour per point. As we move through the project everyone reviews everyone's information to be in agreement and make sure we are working correctly. Although we have assigned activities and roles to each member, the assigned tasks may vary because we try to have flexibility and that we all develop in all areas to have better performance.

**Enrique**:

**Omar**: And that was all,  in conclusion our project has a very big aspiration, we are looking forward into making businesses become the number one option by providing trustability and amability to our clients.
We are excited to launch the new features we just talked to you about, always having in mind what the enterprise needs.
