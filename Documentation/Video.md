**Omar**: Hello itâ€™s my turn to talk to you about the updates on our project.
At first we were supposed to use python for our front end and back end, then, we switched to JavaScript and realized the best option was using JavaScript on our front end and Java on our backend.
These modifications have an impact and caused a delay on our delivery dates.
Right now, we have our database and the bot already uploaded to the cloud, our next couple steps is to create our MVC design, switch our language to Java and have the 85% of the bot ready

**Ruth**: Ok, let's talk about what's next. We look forward to fine-tuning the details of our project very soon.

We developed our bot in javascript, but this language is not a language that easily handles the object oriented part. So we are having problems to connect each class in place, because the whole system is developed based on the bot.on function that receives the text entered by the user and evaluates it in the algorithm built to give an answer either menu, quote or appointment schedule.
So finally we will finish the bot classes and upload the database to the cloud.
