**Rafael**: Hello, my name is Alberto Perea, I am responsible for the Astro project, these last weeks we have been working hard, making significant progress in this regard, but who are we?

We are a company dedicated to the repair and maintenance of Xbox One controllers. Anyone can repair an xbox controller, but the difference is in the customer service system and this is to create a bot where it is fully automated to give a budget, schedule and above all create a record of all customer

**Omar**: No caption

**Enrique**: In the course of the first month, the project idea was developed, the class diagram and the documentation were elaborated. In this month the database was developed, the bot was created and uploaded to the cloud. This represents 62% of the project.

The processes were developed through meetings with the mentor (Edgar Cambranes), various tasks were developed and added to the repository where the tasks performed are displayed.

**Ruth**: Ok, let's talk about what's next. We look forward to fine-tuning the details of our project very soon.

We developed our bot in javascript, but this language is not a language that easily handles the object oriented part. So we are having problems to connect each class in place, because the whole system is developed based on the bot.on function that receives the text entered by the user and evaluates it in the algorithm built to give an answer either menu, quote or appointment schedule
