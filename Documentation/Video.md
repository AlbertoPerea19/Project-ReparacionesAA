**Rafael**: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of 'Facultad de matemáticas', I would like to welcome you here today. For those of you who don’t know me yet, my name is 'Rafael Perea' and I’m responsible for this project. Today we are here to talk to you about "astro". "Astro" is a work plan that I personally find extremely interesting because of the great areas of opportunity and improvement that it has. With the help of "astro" we offer a greater optimization in the development of the activities of small and medium-sized companies.

**Rafael**: Now I would like to look at how we do this big project, for this we create a calendar where we have established a time for each of the activities, here we schedule dates for the progress of the project, the start and end of each sprint, meetings with senior management and many other activities. In addition to this, we created a chronogram where each of the scheduled tasks is specified. With this we expect to deliver the "Astro" project on time and in perfect conditions.

**Ruth**: On the use cases we describe provide quotation and repair report from the system and also describe for the user request for quote and select repair.
If we talk about teamwork we work through a log of meetings with scrum model using sprints and the Teams platform clarifying details in WhatsApp, where we divide the work and everyone scores their performance based on hours of work, approximately 1 hour per point. As we move through the project everyone reviews everyone's information to be in agreement and make sure we are working correctly. Although we have assigned activities and roles to each member, the assigned tasks may vary because we try to have flexibility and that we all develop in all areas to have better performance.
