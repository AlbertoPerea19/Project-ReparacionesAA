**Omar**: Hello itâ€™s my turn to talk to you about the updates on our project.
At first we were supposed to use python for our front end and back end, then, we switched to JavaScript and realized the best option was using JavaScript on our front end and Java on our backend.
These modifications have an impact and caused a delay on our delivery dates.
Right now, we have our database and the bot already uploaded to the cloud, our next couple steps is to create our MVC design, switch our language to Java and have the 85% of the bot ready
